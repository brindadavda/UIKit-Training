Chargetrip's custom real-world range provides a carefully calculated display range for all-electric vehicle models.
Chargetrip range is based on the theoretical distance driven using only the electric engine.
Vehicles that do not have a full electric drivetrain type (all except Battery Electric Vehicles / BEV) therefore return relatively small ranges.
